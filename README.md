TODO:

1. Navbar for home page at top and left

2. The left-side input section on the homepage, should be scrollable

3. Right part chatbox, Can use current one, but once update need "approve" button

4. Preview page add "edit" and "download"

5. Modify page add in-line edit, and modify page need that "approve" for change

6. Functional "Download" function for preview page

7. Loading for preview page after click approve in homepage, maybe need to show the progress of backend process
