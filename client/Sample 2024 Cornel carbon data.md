2024 Cornell Carbon Report

1) Carbon goal

Cornell’s headline goal is net-zero (carbon neutral) by 2035 for the Ithaca campus. This goal sits in the university’s Climate Action Plan (CAP), a living roadmap first adopted in 2009 and updated over time. The original target was set for 2050 in 2009, but an acceleration in 2014 pushed the deadline forward. This ambitious target applies specifically to the Ithaca, NY campus and is measured against a 2008 baseline. To accomplish this, Cornell is focusing on deep reductions in its greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by transitioning away from fossil fuels for energy and improving the efficiency of its buildings and systems.


2) Carbon plan (how they’ll get there)

Cornell’s CAP clusters work into six big moves that “avoid, reduce, replace” emissions:

High-performance buildings / Energy Conservation Initiative (ECI) — continual retrofits, recommissioning, heat recovery and controls to cut demand.

Convert campus heat from steam → hot water — cuts distribution losses (~20%) and enables future carbon-free heat.

Earth Source Heat (deep geothermal) — Cornell drilled a ~2-mile exploratory well (CUBO) with DOE support; 2024 updates say temperatures are sufficient and further permeability testing is proposed.

Peak heat strategy — load shedding and exploring green hydrogen, biofuels, or electric steam boilers for the coldest days.

Renewable electricity — campus currently gets ~20% from solar + hydro; two large NY solar projects are contracted so Cornell is positioned to match 100% of campus electricity with renewables by 2027.

Carbon sinks & sequestration — land-management changes across ~20,000 acres to offset harder-to-abate commuting and air-travel emissions.

3) What Cornell actually did / advanced in 2024

Published a plain-language CAP explainer (“Countdown to Net Zero Emissions,” Apr 3, 2024) detailing the six actions above, the 2027 renewable-power milestone, and next steps for Earth Source Heat.

Earth Source Heat — 2024 status confirms CUBO data show adequate subsurface temperature; next feasibility phase focuses on rock permeability.

Steam → hot water conversion — identified as a critical enabler; Cornell reports ~20% of the campus has converted so far (ongoing multi-year program).

ECI efficiency projects — continued upgrades in research buildings (e.g., Duffield humidification/airflow improvements; major savings in Biotechnology Building).

Renewable electricity trajectory — Cornell reiterated the by-2027 renewable matching timeline via two large solar PPAs, complementing existing solar + hydro resources (~20% today).

Most recent reported totals (SIMAP public dashboard):

FY2024 gross emissions: 295,312 metric tons CO₂e

FY2024 net emissions (after offsets/sequestration): 267,347 metric tons CO₂e

FY2024 by scope: Scope 1 153,661; Scope 2 6,068; Scope 3 135,584 metric tons CO₂e
(Notes: 2024 scope-3 includes sizable air travel (~46,742 tCO₂e) and a large “FERA” category entry.)
